- Hello, my name is Joshua Twardosz
- I am currently working on my portfolio here on Github!
- I mainly work with Python, Java and SQL. However, I am constantly trying to learn more technologies.
- Any feedback would be helpful. I am currently looking for a job but am also attending school to get my bachelors in Computer Science.
- I worked with a great group on a project called SpilledCoffee for one of our CS courses. Please check it out!
- Also currently working with a friend on a simple webapp over at greatCodesWow to start learning more about webdevelopment in django and react.
