- Hello, my name is Joshua Twardosz
- I am currently working on my portfolio here on Github!
- So far, I mainly work with Python, Java and SQL. However, I am constantly trying to learn more technologies.
- Any feedback would be helpful. I am currently looking for a job but am also attending school to get my bachelors in Computer Science.
